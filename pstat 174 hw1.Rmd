3a.
```{r}
Zt=rnorm(300)
plot(Zt, main="Plot of Time Series", type='l')
Ztacf=acf(Zt,plot=F)
plot(Ztacf,main="Plot of Auto Covariance Function")
```
3b.
```{r}
Y=Zt^2
plot(Y, main="Plot of Time Series Y=Zt^2", type='l')
Yacf=acf(Y,plot=F)
plot(Yacf,main="Plot of Auto Covariance Function Y=Zt^2")
```

3c. The acf of Y and Zt appear to be similar enogh to be from a gausian white noise function with both functions being stationary.
However, one stark difference of the Y acf function is that the values appear to vary less implying that Y could very well come from a non-gausian distribution.

```{r}
matA=matrix(c(6,4,-2,1,-1,2,-2,1,-1),3,3,byrow=TRUE)
matA
matB=matrix(c(2,-1,0),3,1)
matB
matAin=solve(matA)
matAin
matAin%*%matB
```

polyroot(c(1,-2))
polyroot(c(1,-.45,.05))
